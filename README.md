# Shalach Manot Ordering Website

## About

This is a custom-built website for a popular annual synagogue fundraiser that
involves sponsoring baskets for the Jewish holiday of Purim. We call it
Shalach Manot. Others may call it Misloach Manos or similar. The code and
associated artifacts represent a labor of love that has gone on for over a decade.
